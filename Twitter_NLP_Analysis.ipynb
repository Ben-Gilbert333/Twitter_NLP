    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project we analyzed over 8,000 tweets from the 2011 SXSW festival. The dataframe used consisted of the text in the tweet, the sentiment of the tweet (rated by a human), and the product/brand the tweet was directed towards. Before modeling we performed a preprocessing approach that included:\n",
    "\n",
    "- standardizing\n",
    "- removing stopwords\n",
    "- tokenizing\n",
    "- stemming\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we began to build models that aimed to predict the sentiment associated with each tweet. Our final model is 67% accurate. This is 7% more accurate than our dummy model. Throughout this process we reached the conclusion that designing products more similar to Apple's will receive better reactions from the public. Next steps include creating a binary model, using our model to analyze tweets after the 2024 SXSW event, and improving data collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "We are Orange, a tech company, looking to improve our next product release at SXSW 2024. This festival is a great opportunity for major tech companies like Google, Apple and now Orange, to reveal new products and obtain a good public image. By analyzing tweets from a previous SXSW event and the sentiment associated with each tweet we attempt to build a model that can predict the sentiment when given text from a tweet. This will help us in the future understand how our new products are being recepted by the public. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this project we chose accuracy as the metric to focus on. We decided that positive, negative, and neutral tweets all add value to determining how to handle product design in the future based on sentiment towards previous products. Given this train of thought we didn't find it necessary to optimize any class over the other and thought accuracy score would be best to use in order to evaluate our models."

    "## Data Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "The data comes from CrowdFlower via [data.world](https://data.world/crowdflower/brands-and-product-emotions). It consists of over 8,000 tweets about Apple and Google products from the 2011 South by Southwest (SXSW) event. Human raters rated the sentiment of the tweets as positive, negative, neutral, or indistinguishable. There are 3 columns including the tweet, the product the tweet is about, and the sentiment of the tweet. The variable we used as the target is sentiment. Our goal is to find key words in tweets that can be used to identify the sentiment of each tweet. \n",

Neutral tweets do not add much value in the big picture and created a distinct class imbalance making it difficult to create a successful model.\n",

With improved data we could get more granular and discover which specific products the sentiment is directed towards rather than just the company."
