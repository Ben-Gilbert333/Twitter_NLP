    "The data comes from CrowdFlower via [data.world](https://data.world/crowdflower/brands-and-product-emotions). It consists of 9,000 tweets about Apple and Google products from a South by Southwest (SXSW) event. Human raters rated the sentiment of the tweets as positive, negative, neutral, or indistinguishable. There are 3 columns including the tweet, the product the tweet is about, and the sentiment of the tweet. The variable we used as the target is sentiment. Our goal is to find key words in tweets that can be used to identify the sentiment of each tweet. "

These charts are how we decided which tokens needed to be added to our stopwords list.

This process was repeated until we felt the top tokens were diverse and meaningful.\n",

Due to this difference we decided not to add 'social' to our stopwords list."
